This is a simulation I wrote based on [this Andre Bandarra video](https://youtu.be/7Mw7ioso9YE)

It could be improved... a lot.

It's written in [Processing](https://processing.org/download)

I'm also providing an exe for you so you don't have to download Processing, but no guarantees that it'll work: [Click Here for the Zip File](https://github.com/PYates77/ThermalFinder/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
